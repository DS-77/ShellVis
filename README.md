Final Project: Shell Classification and Generation
---

Goal: This project attempts to classifiy a seashell based on a given RGB image and restore the shell with a given mask of the missing region.

TODO LIST:

- [x] Find a dataset
- [ ] Extract class names from the image names
- [ ] Label Training Dataset using the YOLO 5 notation for classification
- [ ] Augment the dataset to have missing portions and generate masks for them (generation model)
- [ ] Define preprocessing steps
- [ ] Train classification model
- [ ] Train the generation model
- [x] Find best metrics for evaluating the model
- [x] Find comparative models
- [ ] Create figures
- [ ] Write up the report
- [ ] Gather all references
- [ ] (Optional) Make a nice interface for the pipline
